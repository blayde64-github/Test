    documentation="Git is a distributed version control system (VCS) designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency. It allows teams to collaborate on code and track changes in a decentralized manner, meaning every user has a full copy of the project history on their local machine. This enables work to continue seamlessly even when offline, and merges are straightforward. Git is known for its branching and merging capabilities, which facilitate experimentation and separating different lines of development. It's highly robust, able to handle large codebases efficiently, and has become a standard tool in modern software development."/>
