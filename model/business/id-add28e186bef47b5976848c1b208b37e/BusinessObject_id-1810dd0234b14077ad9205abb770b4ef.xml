    documentation="Short about purpose and target group&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The purpose of the CRA is to create conditions for the development of secure products&#xD;&#xA;with digital elements by ensuring that hardware and software products have fewer vulnerabilities&#xD;&#xA;when they are released to the market and that manufacturers take security seriously&#xD;&#xA;throughout the product's entire life cycle. Conditions must also be created for users to be able&#xD;&#xA;to take cybersecurity into account when choosing and using products with digital elements (CE&#xD;&#xA;marking of digital products).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The most important commitments for Sweden For economic actors who want to place products with IT functionality on the internal market, this means that they must ensure that the products are safe from a cyber security perspective and take responsibility for potential vulnerabilities. For authorities, this means&#xD;&#xA;that a large number of products and actors' compliance needs to be ensured.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The CRA imposes extensive requirements on relevant actors, in particular if they provide, produce, distribute or use high-risk products with IT functionality (including extensive requirements on risk management, documentation, transparency, information and cyber security, quality control systems, ecosystem of certification organizations (&quot;notified bodies&quot;) ), standardization, CE marking.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The most important opportunities for Sweden, including the impact on security&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In general, a considerable increase in cyber security in society as a whole as the CE mark&#xD;&#xA;means that you can make informed decisions about purchase and use in the same way as when&#xD;&#xA;you purchase other CE marked products as it certifies that the product lives up to the EU's basic&#xD;&#xA;health -, environmental and safety requirements. The impact on Swedish and European&#xD;&#xA;security is estimated to be very large in terms of the number and type of affected&#xD;&#xA;products and actors.&#xD;&#xA;The proposal is still being negotiated and there are still some uncertainties that need to be dealt&#xD;&#xA;with, for example the relationship to national security and the design of the proposal for&#xD;&#xA;vulnerability management.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Time perspective (when it starts to apply)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The current proposal was presented on 15 September 2022 and negotiations will likely&#xD;&#xA;begin in April 2025. Adopted in 2024 at the earliest for national implementation by 2026.">
