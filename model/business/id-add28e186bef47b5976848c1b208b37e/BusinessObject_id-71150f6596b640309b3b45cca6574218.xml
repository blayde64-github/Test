Colors or other aspects of a presentation may need to be corrected.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Should we consider Sales' opinions on the PowerPoints?&#xD;&#xA;Rationale for No: There will be as many opinions about the PowerPoints as there are people. It's better that the stored PowerPoints are &quot;good enough&quot; and that Sales edit them as needed.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Will we create one sales powerpoint that cover several questions and then re-use that file in several questions or create on PowerPoint which cover the specific question?">
