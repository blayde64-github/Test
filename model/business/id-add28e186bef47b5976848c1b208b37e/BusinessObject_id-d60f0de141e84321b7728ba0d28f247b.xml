    documentation="Short about purpose and target group&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The Al Regulation targets all providers, manufacturers, distributors (and to some extent users) of&#xD;&#xA;Al systems (information systems that use Al algorithms).&#xD;&#xA;The purpose of the proposal for a regulation is to harmonize rules for Al within the EU and to:&#xD;&#xA;1. ensure that Al systems deployed and used in the internal market are secure and are&#xD;&#xA;developed and used in accordance with fundamental rights, in accordance with&#xD;&#xA;the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights, and Union values;&#xD;&#xA;2. ensure legal certainty and predictability to facilitate investment and innovation in Al,&#xD;&#xA;3. improve governance and effective enforcement of existing laws on fundamental rights&#xD;&#xA;and security requirements applicable to Al and 4. facilitate the&#xD;&#xA;development of a single market for legal, safe and reliable Al systems and prevent&#xD;&#xA;fragmentation.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The most important commitments for Sweden&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Prohibition of certain forms of &quot;high-risk Al&quot;, extensive requirements on relevant actors,&#xD;&#xA;in particular if they provide, produce, distribute or use high-risk Al systems (including extensive&#xD;&#xA;requirements on risk management, &quot;data governance&quot;, documentation, transparency,&#xD;&#xA;human transparency, information and cyber security (all-risk), quality control&#xD;&#xA;systems, ecosystem of certification organizations (&quot;notified bodies&quot;), standardization, CE&#xD;&#xA;marking, introduction of &quot;regulatory sandboxes&quot; (environments where Al systems can be&#xD;&#xA;developed in a safe manner, and where not having to comply with regulation - a mechanism&#xD;&#xA;to support innovation and test ideas before deciding on a venture that can be very expensive),&#xD;&#xA;strong oversight (deep access to sensitive data (including source code), high penalties (in some&#xD;&#xA;cases the highest of EUR 30,000,000 million or 6&#xD;&#xA;% of global turnover), closure of service, dismissal of persons in a managerial position).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The most important opportunities for Sweden, including the impact on&#xD;&#xA;security&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Al has long been used by many companies and in the public sector. Development is fast.&#xD;&#xA;At the same time, Al technology means that systems can be trained to perform a task while it is&#xD;&#xA;being performed. Over time, this may mean that the Al system begins to act in unforeseen or&#xD;&#xA;unauthorized ways. The Al regulation provides legal opportunities to collectively manage the&#xD;&#xA;risks that Al systems entail and may entail, especially when they are used to provide socially&#xD;&#xA;important services, in the activities of authorities or in other respects. The core of the Al&#xD;&#xA;regulation is therefore about ensuring that Al systems maintain a high level of accuracy&#xD;&#xA;(that they do what they are meant to do, that they do nothing other than what they are meant to&#xD;&#xA;do and that we can trust that this is the case) over their entire life cycle, as well as enabling society&#xD;&#xA;to intervene if that level of accuracy is not maintained.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The regulation will clarify an area that is currently characterized by a lot of uncertainty&#xD;&#xA;regarding development and use. This is deemed to contribute positively to safe&#xD;&#xA;products and consequently safety in a wider perspective.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Time perspective (when it starts to apply)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The regulation may be adopted in 2023 and will come into effect two years later.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;">
