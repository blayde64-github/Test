    documentation="Short about purpose and target group&#xD;&#xA;On 18 April 2023, the EU Commission presented the proposal for the Cyber Solidarity Act.&#xD;&#xA;The act will strengthen Member States' solidarity and coordinated response capacity to cross-&#xD;&#xA;border cyber threats and incidents. The act will release resources to strengthen resilience and&#xD;&#xA;situational awareness in the face of cyber threats, while strengthening the existing cooperation&#xD;&#xA;framework.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The proposal for a Cyber Solidarity Act was established in the EU's Joint Communication on a Cyber&#xD;&#xA;Defense Policy adopted on 10 November 2022. The act aims to support the gradual build-up of&#xD;&#xA;a common cyber reserve at EU level with services from trusted private providers, ready to intervene&#xD;&#xA;at the request of Member States in the event of large-scale antagonistic cyber incidents. The&#xD;&#xA;Commission's proposal for a common cyber reserve also includes initiatives to establish&#xD;&#xA;cybersecurity certificates for trusted private companies. 9&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The objective described in the act must be implemented through the following measures:&#xD;&#xA;1. European Cyber Shield (the establishment of national Security Operations Centers (SOC)-&#xD;&#xA;platforms).&#xD;&#xA;2. Cyber Emergency Mechanism (the establishment of a cyber reserve)&#xD;&#xA;3. European Cybersecurity Incident Review Mechanism (the establishment of a common&#xD;&#xA;mechanism for the review of cyber security incidents)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The most important commitments for Sweden&#xD;&#xA;MSB takes an overall positive view of the proposal, but sees a need for clarifications to overcome&#xD;&#xA;certain challenges that the proposal contains.&#xD;&#xA;MSB assesses that the cyber solidarity act will aim to highlight civil-military cooperation and private-&#xD;&#xA;public cooperation. MSB assesses that the EU sees cooperation with trusted and reliable&#xD;&#xA;suppliers from the private sector as crucial to achieving redundancy in cyber defense and&#xD;&#xA;security. In order to ensure a high level of trust towards the private sector, and to enable private&#xD;&#xA;(cybersecurity) companies to participate in such work, the Commission is considering supporting the&#xD;&#xA;development of cybersecurity certification of trusted companies. 10&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The most important opportunities for Sweden, including the&#xD;&#xA;impact on security&#xD;&#xA;There are requests from Member States to establish a fund that is activated in the event of large-scale cyber&#xD;&#xA;attacks. The fund must secure financial resources to deal with incidents, for example to activate the&#xD;&#xA;cyber reserve. When this happens, the EU must be able to support member states under attack with the&#xD;&#xA;necessary skills and resources. While respecting the principle that the Union's budget is established annually,&#xD;&#xA;the Cyber Solidarity Act should (due to the unpredictable nature of cyber security) provide&#xD;&#xA;for possibilities to use unused financial resources beyond those provided for in the Financial Regulation, and&#xD;&#xA;to maximize the capacity of the Emergency Mechanism to assist Member States. With a total budget of&#xD;&#xA;EUR 1.1 million, there are presumably good opportunities for Swedish initiatives to take part in funding.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;MSB considers it likely that several member states see problems with bringing in foreign private actors to deal&#xD;&#xA;with national security incidents. MSB therefore believes that it is not only necessary to clarify escalation&#xD;&#xA;pictures, but also to set clear guidelines regarding ownership, security classification and coordination in the&#xD;&#xA;event of an incident. 11&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Furthermore, the act states that the Commission shall report regularly to the NIS CG on the use of the support&#xD;&#xA;(cyber-reserve). Here MSB assesses it as an increased influence that benefits the NIS CG and thus the&#xD;&#xA;member states.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Time perspective (when it starts to apply)&#xD;&#xA;The European Commission adopted the proposal for the Cyber Solidarity Act on 18 April 2023. 12&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;">
