    documentation="Short about purpose and target group&#xD;&#xA;The policy is mentioned for the first time in the Strategic Compass which was presented in 2022 to&#xD;&#xA;further develop the EU's cybersecurity framework. The strategic compass points out a common&#xD;&#xA;direction for member states where defense should include the cyber domain and that&#xD;&#xA;cyber defense should act as a sort of umbrella for all cyber issues.&#xD;&#xA;On 10 November 2022, a joint communication on a cyber defense policy was&#xD;&#xA;presented, produced by the European External Action Service (EEAS) together with the Commission&#xD;&#xA;and the European Defense Agency (EDA).&#xD;&#xA;The Communication aims to strengthen the Union's cyber defense capabilities,&#xD;&#xA;including the Member States' ability to conduct joint cyber operations, strengthen&#xD;&#xA;coordination, information sharing and cooperation between cyber security and cyber defence. 7&#xD;&#xA;The policy aims at more effective cyber crisis management within the EU and to help reduce&#xD;&#xA;strategic dependencies on critical cyber technology and at the same time strengthen the&#xD;&#xA;European defense technological industrial base (The EU's Defense Technological and Industrial Base,&#xD;&#xA;EDTIB) in the area.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It is important to highlight the policy as a kind of framework or document of will for how a member&#xD;&#xA;state should implement and launch the initiatives the policy prescribes to achieve cyber solidarity.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The policy will also promote training and exercise, the ability to attract and retain competence&#xD;&#xA;in the cyber area and expand cooperation with the EU's partners in cyber defence.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The most important commitments for Sweden&#xD;&#xA;The policy should be understood as a direction for how the Commission and the EEAS view&#xD;&#xA;the EU's current and future investments and developments in cyber defence. The goal is to&#xD;&#xA;streamline common situational images, preparations, response and recovery in the event of&#xD;&#xA;cyber attacks, based on the implementation proposals and plans mentioned in the policy.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The policy proposes that a &quot;cyber task force&quot; should be established within the EU which should&#xD;&#xA;be able to assist organizations with penetration tests, vulnerability scans, advice and&#xD;&#xA;incident management.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It also proposes the establishment of a cyber reserve consisting of EU-based services&#xD;&#xA;trusted private providers who, with the support of funds from the EU, can be sent to&#xD;&#xA;organizations or authorities in the event of significant cross-border incidents.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;7 EU Policy on Cyber Defence, Joint Communication to the European Parliament and the council, Brussels, 10.11.2022&#xD;&#xA;JOIN(2022) 49 final, page 1 Introduction.&#xD;&#xA;https://www.eeas.europa.eu/sites/default/files/documents/Comm_cyber%20defence.pdf&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The policy proposes far-reaching proposals for expanded work with cyber defense within the EU.&#xD;&#xA;Among other things, it is proposed that a coordination center for military cyber defense issues be&#xD;&#xA;established, Security Operations Center (SOC) activities be built up, integration with NATO be established,&#xD;&#xA;the cyber diplomatic toolbox be strengthened, regulation of the defense sector be introduced, new&#xD;&#xA;efforts to regulate and finance &quot;critical cyber technologies&quot; be introduced, etc.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The most important opportunities for Sweden, including the impact on security&#xD;&#xA;Several of the proposals in the joint communication on a cyber defense policy could lead to major changes&#xD;&#xA;to both cyber defense and cyber security cooperation in the EU.&#xD;&#xA;Cyber defense is based on capabilities that are entirely within the mandate of the member states, while&#xD;&#xA;the European Commission has the right to propose laws in the area of cyber security.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If the policy's proposals are implemented, it could have far-reaching effects in a number of areas that&#xD;&#xA;affect cyber security, secure communications, space issues and protection of critical infrastructure.&#xD;&#xA;MSB believes that the policy's proposals must be weighed against the member states' right to govern&#xD;&#xA;themselves how national security is to be organized and ensured.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The government welcomes the common skills development policy advocates and emphasizes that&#xD;&#xA;cyber security must be based on the individual needs of the member states. The government also&#xD;&#xA;emphasizes that the EU's strategic partnership with NATO continues to be of central importance, and&#xD;&#xA;cooperation should thus be characterized by complementarity. 8&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Time perspective (when it starts to apply)&#xD;&#xA;As this is a joint communication and not legally binding, there are no specified timeframes but the&#xD;&#xA;Commission and the High Representative will present an annual report to monitor and assess progress in&#xD;&#xA;implementation. Member States are encouraged to provide feedback on how implementation&#xD;&#xA;measures are progressing nationally or collaboratively. An implementation plan could be drawn up&#xD;&#xA;in cooperation with the Member States.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The cyber defense policy is dealt with during the Swedish EU presidency, which extends between 1&#xD;&#xA;January and 30 June 2023.">
