    documentation="Short about purpose and target group&#xD;&#xA;The purpose of the DORA regulation is to contribute to increased digital operational resilience&#xD;&#xA;within the EU's financial sector and its critical ICT (information and communication-related)&#xD;&#xA;services. For example, DORA will apply to organizations that provide:&#xD;&#xA;audit services, insurance services, banking and financial services, crypto&#xD;&#xA;services, securities services and third party ICT service providers.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The most important commitments for Sweden&#xD;&#xA;Provisions on ICT risk management, reporting and management of ICT-related incidents,&#xD;&#xA;ICT security testing, ICT third-party risk management and information sharing.&#xD;&#xA;Penalty fees will be based on the severity of the non-compliance.&#xD;&#xA;In the case of IT third-party providers, a penalty fee will be issued on a daily basis until the&#xD;&#xA;operator fixes the problem. In some cases, the penalty can be up to 1% of the business's&#xD;&#xA;global turnover.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The most important opportunities for Sweden, including the impact on&#xD;&#xA;security&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;DORA aims to further increase the financial sector's IT security and, thereby, its resilience&#xD;&#xA;to digital disruption and cyber risks.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The regulations will drive the financial sector to identify resilience for critical functions and&#xD;&#xA;underlying processes. At the same time, the financial sector is of great importance to&#xD;&#xA;the entire society both in peacetime and during high alert. Financial services is one of the 10&#xD;&#xA;designated preparedness sectors6 and the regulation will make an important contribution&#xD;&#xA;to the robustness, resilience and redundancy of the sector in the digital domain. This contributes&#xD;&#xA;to increased capability both with regard to Sweden's crisis preparedness and total defence.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Time perspective (when it starts to apply)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The new regulation will also mean closer cooperation within Europe and between suppliers,&#xD;&#xA;which strengthens common European security on the market. ESA (European Supervisory&#xD;&#xA;Authorities) will, among other things, have new areas of responsibility and will have to&#xD;&#xA;take on greater responsibility within the EU, e.g. vis-a-vis ICT third-party suppliers.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Time perspective (when it starts to apply)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The regulation went into effect on January 16, 2023. After that, financial entities have twentyfour months to comply with DORA. On January 17, 2025, the regulation begins to be applied.&#xD;&#xA;">
