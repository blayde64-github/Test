    documentation="This business process involves the creation of a Personal Access Token (PAT) and its subsequent storage. A PAT serves as a unique identifier for individuals to access specific resources or perform certain actions within a system or application. The process begins with the generation of a PAT by a user, typically through a designated interface. The PAT is then securely stored in a suitable location, ensuring its confidentiality and accessibility for future use. This process enables authorized individuals to authenticate themselves and gain appropriate access privileges within the system."/>
