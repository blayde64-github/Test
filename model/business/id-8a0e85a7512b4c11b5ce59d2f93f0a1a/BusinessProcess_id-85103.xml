    documentation="Architecture Process Version 2 (APV2). is designed to be simpler in some ways than its predecessor; Both designs aim to provide a level of ISO42010 compliant architecture design. Rather than using a complete high-level design as our main metric of success the architecture view becomes the cornerstone. Rather than focusing only on a full High Level Design we focus on defining the right architecture views to meet an agreed set of needs from our stakeholders. By focusing on the view rather than only the complete design we can more easily see progress over time and the whole architecture process becomes more transparent.&#xA;"/>
