    documentation="Has the question been partially addressed? Often questions are understood in an inconsistent way and the architecture review guide helps here. Within it we have the criteria for assessment. normally there are sub questions in there to help the assessor make sure they answer the question fully. If the answer to any question in the assessments is no, then the architecture is not fully complete."/>
