    documentation="From Arctic hub product information: &quot;Arctic Hub allows you to share only the relevant information matched to your clients. Our incident notifications are directly actionable and allow recipients to know which security issues to fix. This stops you and your customers from being overwhelmed with threat information and allows you to focus on what matters.&quot;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&quot;Customers value the threat intelligence data thatâ€™s relevant to them. Arctic Hub automatically maps threat data to your customers based on their internet presence so you can specify in detail which types of threat intelligence packages you want to send to whom. You can share packages via email reports or direct API access.&quot;"/>
