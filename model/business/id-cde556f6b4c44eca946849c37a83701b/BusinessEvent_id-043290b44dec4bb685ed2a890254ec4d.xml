    documentation="The Dunning-Kruger effect is a cognitive bias in which people with low ability at a task overestimate their ability. Essentially, it's a mismatch between perceived competence and actual competence.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The Dunning-Kruger effect was first described by David Dunning and Justin Kruger of Cornell University in their 1999 study. They found that the least competent individuals often rated their own ability much higher than it actually was, while the most competent individuals rated their own ability lower than it actually was.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The phenomenon can be summarized as: &quot;The less you know, the less you realize you don't know.&quot; This is because a basic level of expertise or knowledge is often required to self-assess one's competence accurately.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Dunning and Kruger suggested that for a given skill, incompetent people will:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Fail to recognize their own lack of skill.&#xD;&#xA;Fail to recognize genuine skill in others.&#xD;&#xA;Fail to recognize the extent of their inadequacy.&#xD;&#xA;Recognize and acknowledge their own lack of skill only after they are exposed to training for that skill.">
