    documentation="The threat exploits coding bugs or design f laws (e.g. buffer overf lows, improper validation of input) in an organisation’s information systems in order to gain unauthorised access.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Assessment guidance:&#xD;&#xA;Vulnerabilities that threats will attempt to exploit can exist in:&#xD;&#xA;ԉ      applications (e.g. end-user applications)&#xD;&#xA;ԉ      services (e.g. web servers, database management systems)&#xD;&#xA;ԉ      operating systems (e.g. Microsoft Windows, Linux, Apple macOS, IBM z/OS)&#xD;&#xA;ԉ      virtual systems (e.g. virtual servers and virtual desktops)&#xD;&#xA;ԉ      networking equipment (e.g. routers, wireless access points and firewalls)&#xD;&#xA;ԉ      mobile devices (e.g. tablets and smartphones).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;At lower levels of threat strength the threat is likely to target mainstream software and exploit publicly available, commonly known vulnerabilities (i.e. those that have been known for a long period of time and are likely to have corresponding patches available). At higher levels of threat strength the threat is more likely to exploit recent vulnerabilities (that may only recently have been patched) or unpublicised vulnerabilities (often referred to as ‘zero-day’ vulnerabilities), for which there are unlikely to be patches available. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Additionally, these threats may target less common information systems (i.e. custom SCADA controllers) in use by specific organisations.">
