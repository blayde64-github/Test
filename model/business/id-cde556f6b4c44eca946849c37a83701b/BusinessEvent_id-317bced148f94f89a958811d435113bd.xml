    documentation="We do it because we want to leverage common ways of working, making things traceable and consistent. We want to leverage the knowledge of all those architects and specialists that worked together to make these standards. and we want to avoid the risks and vulnerabilities here. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In a governed organization you would expect to see: &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Architecture Framework: A set of tools, processes, and principles that guides the creation and maintenance of IT architectures. We have an engagement model, and a set of uncommunicated and unfollowed and unenforced principles &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Governance Structure: Clearly defined roles and responsibilities for decision-making, including an architecture review board or governance committee. Theres no properly established boards. They tried running a cross team architecture board, but it very rarely happened. Roles not understood or communicated. Are they even defined? &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Standards and Policies: Established technical and business standards, policies, and best practices that align with the organization’s objectives. There are no formal architecture processes. EA doesn’t govern policies or properly define standards. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Architecture Artifacts: Documentation of the enterprise architecture, including models, diagrams, and interface definitions. There are several model repositories, but everything is fragmented and quality in many areas is so poor the architecture models provide little value. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Compliance Mechanisms: Processes to ensure that projects and initiatives comply with the defined architecture, including audits and assessments. There are not any QA processes around architecture, outside of the proposed Security Architecture Review process. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Change Management: Procedures for managing changes to the architecture, ensuring that they are systematic and controlled. There are some points where architecture design is required according to drafts of the engagement model. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Stakeholder Engagement: Processes to engage stakeholders to ensure that the architecture meets the needs of the business. This may happen with putting architecture review back into product development, but it would likely be limited to a small number of stakeholders. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Strategic Alignment: Ensuring that the IT strategy and architecture are aligned with the business strategy and objectives. This is done at a high level - ad hoc, rather than by aligning to a formal architecture. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Training and Awareness Programs: Education for staff and stakeholders on the principles and benefits of architecture governance. Its been deprioritised. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Performance Metrics: Key performance indicators to measure the effectiveness of the architecture governance. Enterprise security architecture team have some metrics but without people doing architecture, dashboards will look bare. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Communication Plan: A plan to communicate the goals, benefits, and updates regarding architecture governance within the organization. Outside of things Owen Richardson has done, this does not exist. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Tooling: Use of specialized software and tools to support architecture governance activities, such as architecture repositories or modelling tools. The expensive tools were taken away and replaced with free open-source alternatives. The open-source alternatives are slow and not easy to configure. Nobody takes responsibility for ensuring unity across architecture repositories. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Continuous Improvement: Regular reviews and updates of the governance processes and frameworks to ensure they remain effective and relevant. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Resource Allocation: Adequate resourcing for governance activities, including budget, personnel, and time. There are risks around resourcing logged on archer. &#xD;&#xA;">
