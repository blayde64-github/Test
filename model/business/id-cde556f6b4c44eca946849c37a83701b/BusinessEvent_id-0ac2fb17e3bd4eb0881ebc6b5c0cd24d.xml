    documentation="Not understanding architecture theory or methodology may lead to misconceptions around architecture value. For example, a trained architect would know that properly understanding an architecture modelling language and applying it leads to easier reuse of architecture and significant time gains in preparing new designs. They would also know that the process of running through the methodology is just as important as any architecture modelling and leaving architecture to the end of a project greatly diminishes its value.">
