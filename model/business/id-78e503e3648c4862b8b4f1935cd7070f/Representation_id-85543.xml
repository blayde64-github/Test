The architect is agreeing with the stakeholder the views that must be created for the architecture to be completed. &#xA;Viewpoint definitions show exactly the types of elements and relationships we expect to see, and define the purpose &amp; value of each architecture view.&#xA;To make this job fast and easy - many standard and simplified architecture viewpoint definitions have already been created and as part of this process the intention is that some standard templates are defined.
