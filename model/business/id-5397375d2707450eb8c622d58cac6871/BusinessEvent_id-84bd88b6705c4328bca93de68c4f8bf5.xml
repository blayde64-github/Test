    id="id-84bd88b6705c4328bca93de68c4f8bf5"
    documentation="Within our organization, the absence of clearly defined standards poses significant challenges for quality assurance and security review processes. Without a consistent benchmark to reference, the evaluation of projects becomes subjective, potentially leading to oversights or inconsistencies in assessments. Quality assurance, which relies on set criteria to gauge performance and functionality, struggles to maintain uniformity in its evaluations. Similarly, security reviews, pivotal in ensuring the protection of our assets and data, become less effective as they lack a standardized framework to identify vulnerabilities. This scenario not only puts the quality and security of our projects at risk but also consumes additional resources and time in trying to adapt to varying project specifications. Ultimately, it can erode stakeholder trust and confidence in the organization's outputs.">
