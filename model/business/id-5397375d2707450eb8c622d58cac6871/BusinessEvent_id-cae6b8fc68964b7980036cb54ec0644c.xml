    documentation="We all have seen many leadership team presentations, where they state our goals and changes of direction. With the best intentions people follow leadership guidance... but then the next presentation comes. Which of the things from the prior presentation is still relevant? How do we turn what leadership asks for into something more real and tangible? This should be happening by managing requirements and principles in design - and then ensuring design is implemented. Otherwise, we end up with very inconsistent implementation of management goals and directives. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Theres a whole world of enterprise architecture discipline that should be applied in understanding and building strategy. EA should be taking what the LT ask for and breaking it down and ensuring its implemented.">
