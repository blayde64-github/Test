    documentation="Lacking standardized guidelines in architectural processes can lead to inconsistency and inefficiency across projects. This absence means there's often a duplication of efforts, with teams addressing similar challenges without leveraging prior solutions.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The result is a failure to capitalize on the potential benefits of adhering to standards. Instead, the organization finds itself incurring added expenses, both monetarily and in terms of time. Such repetitive and disparate approaches not only impact the financial bottom line but also stifle innovation, as resources are consumed readdressing the same issues rather than advancing new initiatives.">
