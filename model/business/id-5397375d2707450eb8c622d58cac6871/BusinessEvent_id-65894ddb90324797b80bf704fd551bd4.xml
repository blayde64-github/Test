    documentation="This loss event encompasses multiple severe consequences. Firstly, there's a loss of reputation, where the organization's public image and trustworthiness are significantly damaged, potentially leading to a decline in customer confidence and business opportunities. Secondly, possible sanctions and penalties may arise, often imposed by regulatory bodies for non-compliance with legal and security standards, leading to financial losses and legal complications. Lastly, there's the loss of confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data, indicating a breach that compromises sensitive information, alters or destroys data, and disrupts access to critical systems. This multifaceted impact can have lasting effects on an organization's operational, financial, and legal standing.">
