    documentation="In our organization, the absence of reusable design principles has led to increased expenditures and missed opportunities for efficiency. Without standardized and repeatable design elements, each project undertaken becomes a fresh endeavour, devoid of lessons learned and efficiencies garnered from previous work. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This approach often results in redundant efforts, with teams recreating solutions that already exist within the organization but are not easily accessible or adaptable due to the lack of standardization. The consequence is not just a financial strain but also a time cost, as projects take longer to complete without the benefit of leveraging existing assets. This failure to capitalize on reusable designs hampers our organization's agility, innovation speed, and overall competitive edge.">
