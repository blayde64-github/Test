    documentation="In the absence of unified architectural standards, our organization experiences fragmentation in its processes. As our architecture work becomes more siloed, there's limited cross-collaboration, hampering our ability to craft holistic solutions that address broader complexities. Working in isolation means our teams might develop redundant systems or miss optimization opportunities available from a collective perspective. This leads to inconsistencies in managing complexity, magnifying operational challenges. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Consequently, we face elevated costs as more resources, time, and effort are required to bridge these gaps, rectify discrepancies, and navigate complications. This not only increases our expenses but also hinders our organization's agility and adaptability.">
