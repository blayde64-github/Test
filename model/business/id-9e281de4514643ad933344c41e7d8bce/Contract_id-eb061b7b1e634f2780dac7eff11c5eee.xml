    documentation="These are the principles we are required to have in place as part of the security baseline. These principles were originally Approved by Esa Kauppi the Head of Enterprise Architecture, and Mikael Lingskog our CISO. They were originally reviewed by the whole of the Cloud and Infra Enterprise Architecture team, and most recently have gone through public review through the Architects Community and have been reapproved by Mikael Lingskog and the new Head of Security &amp; Compliance Mikaela Kemppi. The content of these principles has not changed since version 1.0, and all changes have been to reflect organization changes. "/>
