    documentation="The Implementation and Migration Layer focuses on the transitional phases and elements needed to implement architectural changes, whether they're newly envisioned or adjustments to existing architecture. This layer is paramount for planning, managing, and executing the transformation from an organization's baseline architecture to its target architecture. By leveraging the Implementation and Migration Layer, we can ensure smoother transitions, mitigate risks, and allocate resources more effectively during the evolution of the architecture."/>
