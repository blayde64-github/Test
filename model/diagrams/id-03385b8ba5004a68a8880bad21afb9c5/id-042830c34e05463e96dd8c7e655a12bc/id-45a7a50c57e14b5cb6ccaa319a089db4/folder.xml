    documentation="Business Layer provides a model to represent the business-level components of an organization. It primarily focuses on the organizational entities, their objectives, roles, processes, and how they interact with each other. Within this layer, the key elements include business actors (people or organizations), business roles (responsibilities), business processes (sequences of business activities with a specific goal), business functions (collections of business behaviour based on certain criteria, often hierarchical), and business objects (passive elements that have relevance from a business perspective). These elements are interrelated, defining how business entities operate and interact, making it easier to visualize, analyse, and communicate business concepts in the context of enterprise architecture. By modelling at this layer, stakeholders can gain insights into the core operations of the organization, facilitating strategic decision-making and ensuring alignment between business operations and IT systems."/>
