    documentation="The Risk and Security layer focuses on capturing the aspects related to risk management, security concerns, and safeguards within an architecture. This layer emphasizes the identification, assessment, and mitigation of potential risks and vulnerabilities that can impact an organization's assets and objectives. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It provides a structured approach to understand threats, vulnerabilities, and potential impacts, ensuring that the architecture incorporates necessary safeguards. By modelling at this layer, we can ensure that our architectural designs and operational structures are resilient against threat and have mechanisms in place to address security incidents and breaches."/>
