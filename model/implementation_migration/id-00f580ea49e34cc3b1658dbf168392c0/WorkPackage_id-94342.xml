    documentation="S&amp;C Internal IAM + PAM Deployment&#xA;&#xA;Goal:&#xA;&#xA;Enable common secured access for Users&#xA;&#xA;-    This project primary goal is to enable Internal Identity access Management and Privilege Access Management services for Tietoevry Connect in the locations where TE Connect platform has been deployed. These services allow our administrators to gain access to the systems running on top of the platform.&#xA;&#xA;-    Project will consume the design realized by Internal IAM + PAM development project. Project will deploy the solutions to locations defined in sub-projects. &#xA;&#xA;-    Current estimation is that the service needs to be deployed to several locations in Sweden, Norway and in Finland. &#xA;&#xA;-    Project is driven by Project Manager together with Service Architect, preferably the one who was assigned on the Development project.&#xA;&#xA;-    As there shouldnt be that much of design work on the deployment phase, required resources are mainly technical specialists who can install and configure services or devices based on the design.&#xA;&#xA;-    Project resourcing needs to be revised during development project.&#xA;&#xA;Dependencies&#xA;&#xA;-    Connectivity and Capacity Platform Development has delivered the new platform which supports in-country operations&#xA;&#xA;-    S&amp;C Capability development project has created the design for the new solution for Internal IAM and PAM which supports in-country operations&#xA;&#xA;-    Tietoevry Connect Portfolio Development has delivered the in-country organization so that the system can be transferred to in-country continuous services&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;Resourcing&#xA;&#xA;This project requires extensive skills from various areas. The overall design is led by Service Architect, other roles required:&#xA;&#xA;- Project Manager: Secures the resources and ensures the project is delivering&#xA;&#xA;- Service Architect: Has overall understanding of the deployed system. This resource should be the same as in Development project as she/he has the best understanding of the design.&#xA;&#xA;Technical resources:&#xA;&#xA;Automation Technical SpecialistDevice Management Technical SpeciliastIdentity &amp; Access Management DeveloperIdentity &amp; Access Management Technical SpeciliastNetwork Technical SpecialistRemote Access Systems SpecialistSecurity Technical SpecialistServiceNow DeveloperUnix Technical SpecialistWindows Technical Specialist&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;">
