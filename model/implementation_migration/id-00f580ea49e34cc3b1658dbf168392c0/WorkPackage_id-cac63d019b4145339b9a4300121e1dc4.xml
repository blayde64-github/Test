    documentation="Represents the work that needs to be done  to integrate Security Architecture Review (SAR) with our existing Tech Services Processes. So far, it has been accepted as part of the Architecture Principles, so by rights it should start to be adopted in Q4 of 2023. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If however the Architecture Principles are not followed there is a need to find other points of integration. Utilising this as part of the decision point gates for bids has been discussed, but how we implement this is at the discretion of the leadership team and will be decided in coming weeks."/>
