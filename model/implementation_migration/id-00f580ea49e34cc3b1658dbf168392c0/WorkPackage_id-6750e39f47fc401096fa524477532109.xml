    documentation="Represents the training required for the Enterprise Security Architecture team for performing Security Architecture Reviews. We will eat our own dog food. The intention is to run a series of internal workshops, trying out both level 1 and level 2 assessments, starting with the assessment of the Security Architecture Review High Level Design. This will likely find mall things we need to fix. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Each ESA Architect will perform a SAR2 review of the SAR HLD, after which we will come together and compare results for consistency. The entire exercise should not take more than 24 working hours of effort when you factor in time it will take to learn and review the criteria.&#xD;&#xA;"/>
