Spontaneous adoption of any new tool is typically low in our company.&#xD;&#xA;When creating the communication plan, we need to consider both the launch of the repository as well as its ongoing use.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Current thinking:&#xD;&#xA;* Repository needs to be promoted - e.g. Workplace&#xD;&#xA;* There should be trainings on Teams&#xD;&#xA;* We should personally approach known key contacts in sales/customer teams to recruit them to use the repository and spread the word of it - think key users&#xD;&#xA;* We should build a community around the repository - e.g. Teams, and make sure the community is live with content. We can also use this to get feedback and new questions."/>
