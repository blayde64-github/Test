    documentation="As part of service design services need to maintain an application and technology lifecycle and build and implement plans to migrate services to more modern versions, and decommission older services, removing older toolsets. If it is not done as part of service design it doesnt happen. There are common misconceptions here&#xA;&#xA;1. There will be a natural attrition of technologies as customers move out, or more modern services are onboarded. This is not so - we try to keep customer contracts as long as we can and implementing something new without taking deliberate actionable steps to clean up the old mess leads to situations where core platforms cannot be shut down becuase nobody knows how long services need them, an example is COSMGMT. The first attempt to close it down was in 2014, its still open because a lack of achitecture control on the services its not possible, meaning we have to live with some vulnerability.&#xA;2. Operations are completely responsabile for patching and OS upgrades. Although operations can perform upgrades on OS, they need to be able to understand the impact of such upgrades on different services. its a part of service design to determine what types of software are needed to what version, and also to be aware of the lifecycle of all the software a service needs, becuase it can impact service functionalty and design.  Application and technology have to be designed alongside the business services, or there can never be stability in the business services, or efficiency in the application and technology services.&#xA;"/>
