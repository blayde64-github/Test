    documentation="The Quality Assurance Specialist Outi Hotarinen requested details on the planned solution related to the review control.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;She made a note of the following text in the Management Response Letter:&#xD;&#xA;As part of our security baseline work, we are currently reviewing our existing systems (including AARM2) and upgrading some of our controls and metrics. The baseline mandates the implementation of the Systems Access controls from the Standards of good practice (SOGP). The new implementations of controls will follow the security by design principle and other security related principles established in Tech Services.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Outi's questions were:&#xD;&#xA;&#x9;• Is the plan to utilize AARM2 review functionality and if so, how is it planned to tackle the issue with one person reviewing hundreds or thousands of accounts? &#xD;&#xA;&#x9;• Can we reach the deadline mentioned in the Response Letter, end of February? Or will we have a fully different solution?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Part of Owen's response to Outi:&#xD;&#xA;&#x9;• Need to reassess the overall approach: considering automation, scaling up operations, or removing the control point.&#xD;&#xA;&#x9;• Planning to bring in an architect to work with the team for immediate process improvement.&#xD;&#xA;&#x9;• Aiming for a challenging deadline; process and controls for addressing this and other issues set for February.&#xD;&#xA;&#x9;• Bigger issue: not all users are managed through AARM.&#xD;&#xA;&#x9;• Goals include implementing reviews, a new process, metrics, and supporting policy by February.&#xD;&#xA;&#x9;• Systems access is a high priority for Satu.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Outi emphasized the Management Response Letter deadlines. Planned updates to the Management Response Letter are to be sent on 1st of Feb and 5th of April 2024. Status updates must be provided on those dates, unless of course we can state that the activities are completed. Outi forewarned that she'll reach out to Owen again at a later point.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;"/>
