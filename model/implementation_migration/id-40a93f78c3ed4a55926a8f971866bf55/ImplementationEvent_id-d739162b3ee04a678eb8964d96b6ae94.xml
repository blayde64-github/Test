Sami managed to get us access to their &quot;ISAE2023 Test Documentation&quot; teams which contains lot's of data for us. They have also an internal Teams, which contains working documents - in there Outi cannot provide access but she will send a copy of a couple of interesting documents.&#xD;&#xA; &#xD;&#xA;Sami has also introduced Outi to our new Security Baseline approach - obviously she was delighted to see that there is now progress in that area.&#xD;&#xA; &#xD;&#xA;Within their work, the biggest pressure is the &quot;responce letters&quot; which needs to be finalized week 47 for all the deviations.
