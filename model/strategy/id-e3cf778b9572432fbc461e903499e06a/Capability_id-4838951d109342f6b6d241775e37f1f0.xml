    documentation="This capability involves establishing a structured system development methodology that applies to all types of business systems, including their related technical infrastructure. It is characterized by the support of a formal project management process, the establishment of specialized, segregated development environments, and the incorporation of a quality assurance process. This comprehensive approach ensures that the development of business systems is methodical, controlled, and meets quality standards.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Further, it entails developing business applications in line with an approved system development lifecycle. This lifecycle adheres to industry good practices and integrates information security at each stage, including requirements gathering, design, acquisition (which covers purchase, lease, and open-sourced components), building, testing, implementation, and decommissioning of the systems. This ensures that information security is a fundamental consideration throughout the entire process of developing and managing business applications."/>
