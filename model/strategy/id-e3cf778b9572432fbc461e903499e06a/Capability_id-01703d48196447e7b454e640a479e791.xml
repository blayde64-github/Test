    documentation="This capability entails building a robust technical security infrastructure by applying security architecture principles and integrating technical security solutions. Key components of this infrastructure include malware protection and intrusion detection systems. These elements work together to safeguard the organization's digital assets from various forms of cyber threats, such as viruses, malware, and unauthorized intrusions. By adhering to security architecture principles, the organization ensures that its security infrastructure is cohesive, effective, and capable of responding to evolving threats.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Additionally, the capability includes deploying approved cryptographic solutions across the organization in a consistent manner. These solutions, which may involve encryption, public key infrastructure, and digital signatures, serve several critical functions: they protect the confidentiality of information by ensuring that sensitive data is accessible only to authorized individuals; they help in verifying if critical information has been altered, thereby maintaining data integrity; they provide strong authentication mechanisms to confirm the identity of users accessing the system; and they support non-repudiation, ensuring that actions or transactions cannot be denied retrospectively. Implementing these cryptographic solutions enhances the overall security posture of the organization by adding layers of protection for data and communications."/>
