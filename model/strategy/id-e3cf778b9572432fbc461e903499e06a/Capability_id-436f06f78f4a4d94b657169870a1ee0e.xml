    documentation="This capability centers on restricting access to business applications, mobile devices, systems, and networks to authorized individuals and services (entities) for specific business purposes. This restriction is guided by a formal access control policy and is supported by an Identity and Access Management (IAM) system. The policy ensures that access privileges are granted in alignment with an individual's role within the organization. Additionally, it requires individuals to be authenticated using robust access control mechanisms, such as passwords, tokens, or biometrics, and to undergo a rigorous sign-on process before they are provided with approved levels of access. This methodical approach to access control effectively safeguards sensitive information and systems from unauthorized access.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Moreover, the capability extends to the protection of business applications that offer customer access. This protection is achieved by conducting information risk assessments to identify specific information security requirements. Based on these assessments, security arrangements are implemented, which are supported by agreed, approved contracts. This ensures that customer-facing applications are secure and that the information handled by these applications is adequately protected against potential security threats."/>
