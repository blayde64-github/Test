    documentation="A smart card (aka microprocessor card, chip card, or integrated circuit card) has traditionally taken a pocket-sized card with embedded integrated circuits. Smart cards are often used in two-factor authentication solutions where the user enters a pin which is used by an operating system on the smart card to release evidence of identity such as a digital certificate or to allow a private key to sign an identity token which is sent to an enforcement agent that determines if the identity is valid."/>
