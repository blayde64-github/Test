    documentation="This capability involves managing threats and vulnerabilities associated with business applications, systems, and networks. It includes several key activities: scanning for technical vulnerabilities to identify and assess potential security weaknesses; maintaining up-to-date patch levels to ensure that software and systems are fortified against known vulnerabilities; performing continuous security event monitoring to detect and respond to potential security incidents in real-time; acting on threat intelligence to proactively address emerging threats and adapt security measures accordingly; and protecting information against targeted cyber attacks through various defensive strategies and technologies. These activities are essential for maintaining the security and integrity of business applications, systems, and networks.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Furthermore, the capability extends to establishing a comprehensive and approved information security incident management framework. This framework includes a designated incident response team equipped to handle security breaches and incidents. It also involves access to cyber incident investigators and forensics experts who can conduct in-depth analyses of security incidents. The framework is supported by threat-related information and technical investigation tools to facilitate effective incident response and investigation. Additionally, the framework encompasses a well-defined process for the identification, response, recovery, and post-implementation review of information security incidents. This process ensures that incidents are managed efficiently and that lessons learned are integrated into future security strategies."/>
