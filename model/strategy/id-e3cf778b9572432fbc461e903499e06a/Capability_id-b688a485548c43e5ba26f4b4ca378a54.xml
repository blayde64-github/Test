    documentation="This capability involves the integration of security controls into business applications, including specialized controls for web applications. These controls are designed to protect the confidentiality and integrity of information at all stages: when it is input into the applications, during processing, and upon output. By incorporating these security measures, the applications are fortified against unauthorized access and data breaches, ensuring the safe handling of sensitive information.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Additionally, the capability extends to the development of critical End User Developed Applications (EUDAs), such as spreadsheets. These applications are developed in accordance with an approved development methodology. They are recorded in an inventory to maintain oversight. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Protection for these applications is achieved through several measures: configuring security settings in vendor software, validating input to prevent malicious data entry, implementing robust access controls, restricting user access to powerful functionalities within the applications, and managing changes diligently. This approach ensures that EUDAs, often overlooked in security planning, receive appropriate attention and safeguarding."/>
