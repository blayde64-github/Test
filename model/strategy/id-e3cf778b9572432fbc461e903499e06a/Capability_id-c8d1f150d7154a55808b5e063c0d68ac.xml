    documentation="This capability focuses on identifying and managing information risk in relationships with external suppliers throughout the supply chain. This includes suppliers of hardware and software, outsourcing specialists, and cloud service providers. The management of these risks is achieved through the implementation of a supplier security management framework, which encompasses security-related steering groups, policies, processes, and registers. This framework ensures a structured approach to managing supplier relationships and maintaining security standards.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The capability also involves embedding information security requirements into the procurement process and formal supplier contracts. It includes obtaining assurance that these requirements are met by the suppliers, thus ensuring that security considerations are integral to the procurement and contractual processes. This helps in maintaining a consistent level of security across all external supplier engagements.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Furthermore, the capability extends to establishing and enforcing a comprehensive, documented security management approach for the acquisition, development, and use of cloud services. This approach is communicated to all individuals involved in the procurement, development, configuration, or use of cloud services.
