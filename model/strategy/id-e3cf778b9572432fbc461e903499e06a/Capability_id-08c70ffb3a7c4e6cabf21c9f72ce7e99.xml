    documentation="This capability entails designing physical, wireless, and voice networks with several key objectives: ensuring reliability and resilience, preventing unauthorized access, encrypting connections to safeguard data in transit, and detecting suspicious traffic to mitigate potential security threats. This design philosophy ensures that the networks are robust, secure, and capable of withstanding various challenges.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In addition, the capability involves configuring network devices such as routers, firewalls, switches, and wireless access points. The configuration is aimed at segregating networks into different domains for enhanced security and control. It ensures that these devices function as required and are safeguarded against unauthorized or incorrect updates. This segregation and precise configuration of network devices play a crucial role in maintaining the integrity and security of the network.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Moreover, the capability extends to the protection of electronic communication systems, including email, collaboration platforms, and voice communication platforms. This is achieved by setting clear policies for their use, configuring security settings to protect against unauthorized access and data breaches, and hardening the supporting technical infrastructure. These measures ensure that communication systems are secure, reliable, and used in a manner that aligns with the organization's security protocols."/>
