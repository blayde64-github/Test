    documentation="This capability involves the design and construction of systems, including web servers and virtual instances (such as containers), to ensure secure operation and the ability to handle current and anticipated workloads. These systems are configured in a consistent and accurate manner to protect them—and the information they process and store—from a range of threats, including malfunction, cyber attacks, unauthorized disclosure, corruption, and loss. This comprehensive approach to system design and configuration ensures robust protection against various vulnerabilities and threats.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Additionally, the capability includes managing the security of these systems through several key practices. Regular backups of essential information and software are performed to safeguard against data loss. A rigorous change management process is implemented to control and monitor all changes to the systems, minimizing the risk of introducing vulnerabilities. Capacity requirements are managed to ensure that the systems can handle the workload efficiently without compromising security. Furthermore, performance is continuously monitored against agreed service agreements to ensure that the systems are functioning optimally and securely. This holistic management of system security ensures sustained protection and reliability."/>
