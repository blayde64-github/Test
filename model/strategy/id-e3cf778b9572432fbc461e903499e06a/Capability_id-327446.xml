    documentation="Governance, Risk and Compliance (GRC) describes the overall management approach through which senior executives direct and control the entire organization, using management information and hierarchical management control structures. Governance activities ensure that critical information reaching the executive team is sufficiently complete, accurate, and timely to enable appropriate management decision making and provide the control mechanisms to ensure that strategies, directions, and instructions from management are carried out systematically and effectively. Risk management is the set of processes through which management identifies, analyzes, and, where necessary, responds appropriately to risks that might adversely affect realization of the organizationâ€™s business objectives. The response to risks typically depends on their perceived gravity, and involves controlling, avoiding, accepting or transferring them to a third party. Whereas organizations routinely manage a wide range of risks (e.g. technological risks, commercial/financial risks, information security risks etc.), external legal and regulatory compliance risks are arguably the key issue in GRC."/>
