    documentation="This capability focuses on protecting physical assets throughout their lifecycle, encompassing endpoint devices like workstations, laptops, and servers; office equipment such as network printers and multifunction devices; and specialist devices and equipment, including HVAC systems, barcode scanners, and IoT devices. It addresses the information security requirements at every stage: acquisition (whether through purchase or lease), configuration, maintenance, and disposal of these assets.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Additionally, the capability includes the protection of mobile devices, such as tablets and smartphones, along with the applications they run and the information they handle. This protection is achieved through several measures: configuring security settings on the devices, restricting access to sensitive information, installing security software, and managing the devices centrally through an Enterprise Mobility Management (EMM) solution. These steps help to safeguard against loss, theft, and unauthorized disclosure of information on mobile platforms."/>
