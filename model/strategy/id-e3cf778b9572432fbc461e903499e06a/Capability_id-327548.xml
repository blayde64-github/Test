    documentation="Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) (also called complete packet inspection and Information extraction - IX -) is a form of computer network packet filtering that examines the data part (and possibly also the header) of a packet as it passes an inspection point, searching for protocol non-compliance, viruses, spam, intrusions or predefined criteria to decide if the packet can pass or if it needs to be routed to a different destination, or to collect statistical information."/>
