    documentation="&quot;Traceability&quot; refers to the capability to systematically track the evolution, relationships, and origins of various elements within an architectural framework. This capability provides an in-depth understanding of changes, dependencies, and decision-making rationales at any given point in time. By ensuring traceability, we can maintain a comprehensive overview of our architectural progress, meet compliance requirements, and enhance decision-making. Essentially, traceability serves as a connecting thread that binds different architectural components, granting stakeholders a clear and coherent insight into the architecture's development and its complex interrelationships."/>
