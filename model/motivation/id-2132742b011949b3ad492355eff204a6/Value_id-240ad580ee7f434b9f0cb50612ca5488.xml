    documentation="&quot;Efficiency&quot; denotes the optimization of resources, processes, and systems to achieve desired outcomes with minimal waste or unnecessary effort. This attribute emphasizes the importance of streamlining operations, reducing redundancies, and leveraging technology and best practices to ensure that architectural components deliver maximum value. By prioritizing efficiency, we can achieve faster response times, lower operational costs, and improved performance. Essentially, efficiency serves as a benchmark for measuring the effectiveness of an architecture in transforming inputs into outputs in the most resourceful manner possible."/>
