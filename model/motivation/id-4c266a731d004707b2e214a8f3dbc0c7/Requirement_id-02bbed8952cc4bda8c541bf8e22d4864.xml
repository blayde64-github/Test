    documentation="Threat events relating to the complete cyber attack chain should be identified by reviewing early warning systems (e.g. as part of threat intelligence), supplemented by specific activities that include:&#xA;    maintaining effective relationships with groups that are often involved when prepar-ing for and responding to sophisticated, tar-geted cyber attacks&#xA;    using threat intelligence to help identify imminent or actual targeted attacks, and support an effective response&#xA;    examining activity observed on deployed honeypots (e.g. decoy systems that present fake applications and information in order to observe malicious attackers and collect fo-rensic information about their activity)&#xA;    performing analysis of employee behaviour (e.g. as part of an insider threat programme)&#xA;    implementing methods to help identify in-dividuals who have been placed in the or-ganisation to perform unauthorised activi-ties (e.g. developing an insider threat pro-gramme, establishing an insider threat team and monitoring the behaviour of people).">
