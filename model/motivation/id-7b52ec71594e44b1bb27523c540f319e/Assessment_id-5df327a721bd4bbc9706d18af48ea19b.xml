    documentation="Rationale: Aki is positive towards mandating educations. ESA define what's needed and who needs to participate and enforce it. &quot;if people don't take the trainings, delete their accesses!&quot;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Aki champions a policy of mandatory security education with clear repercussions for non-compliance where failure to participate in required educational programs results in tangible consequences, such as the revocation of system access. This approach ensures adherence to security protocols through a blend of required learning and enforceable accountability, fostering a culture where security education is not just encouraged but integral to the operational continuity of the organization."/>
