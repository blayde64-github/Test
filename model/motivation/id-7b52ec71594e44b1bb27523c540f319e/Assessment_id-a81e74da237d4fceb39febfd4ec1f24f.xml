    documentation="Rationale: Aki likes short and clear checkmarks on what has been done, likes simplified reporting. As another example, he also has no interest in going into detail on SOGP for himself.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Aki values clear and concise communication, particularly in the form of checklists or reports that quickly and straightforwardly convey what has been accomplished. This preference for simplification likely extends to various aspects of work, aiming to reduce unnecessary complexity in processes, communication, and documentation to enhance efficiency and clarity."/>
