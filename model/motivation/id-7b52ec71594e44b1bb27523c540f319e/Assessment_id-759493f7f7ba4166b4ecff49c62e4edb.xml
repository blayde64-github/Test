    documentation="Over the past year several attempts have been made to engage the EA Team in Security Architecture review and other architecture improvement related activities and they have all failed. They have agreed to include Security Architecture into their principles which is excellent, but they do not have an active architecture community or any drive to improve it. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Partially this has been due to a lack of resourcing, and other leadership priorities taking precedence, but whatever the reason, when we pass new things to them, very little happens. See the Risks section for further information. &#xD;&#xA;"/>
