    documentation="During the transformation, the company must be prepared for increased costs in the following ways:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1. Reskilling employees is going to involve a lot of costs; cost of courses, cost for the effort during the course being taken, cost for the time the employees gain experience by actually working. (A course is not a quick fix, it can take a year of learning a new skill, and that employee will not be very efficient.)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;2. If you are reducing roles and letting people go to hire the people with the correct skill, we are going to have people with little to no experience from Tech Services in the company. They're going to take time learning the organization and establishing a network, which will take a couple of years, during which they will be at reduced efficiency.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;3. Recruiting new talent with specific expertise will not be cheap. Tech Service personnel has complained for a long time about their salary situation, and Tech Services is about 5 years behind. Luring talent and retaining talent will very likely require a very large investment."/>
