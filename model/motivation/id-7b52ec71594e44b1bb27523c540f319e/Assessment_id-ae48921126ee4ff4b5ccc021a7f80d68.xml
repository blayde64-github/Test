    documentation="Rationale: When we talk about infrastructure, laptop config, or hardening, ESA should not be advisories. Aki doesn't want us to micro manage the organization. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Aki's directive is for the ESA team to operate in a capacity similar to that of fire inspectors, not only crafting the safety codes but also rigorously inspecting and ensuring adherence to these standards.&#xD;&#xA;This driver underscores the transition towards a proactive audit and compliance model within security."/>
