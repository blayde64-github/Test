    documentation="Rationale: Aki wants to automate as much as possible, with the end result being that someone is assigned to fix things. We should integrate as much as possible with our existing ITSM service. Aki does not like people managing issues through phone calls and other manual activities.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Aki's vision for automation focuses on the deployment of technology to manage tasks that can be standardized, systematic and traceable, with an aim to assign human resources only to those issues that require personal attention and expertise.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This approach not only improves response times and accuracy but also frees up valuable human resources to focus on more complex problems that necessitate a human touch."/>
