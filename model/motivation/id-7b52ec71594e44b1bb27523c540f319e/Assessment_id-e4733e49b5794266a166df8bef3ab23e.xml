    documentation="Rationale: Aki doesn't want ESA to negotiate with other parts of the organization, they are setting the rules.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Aki sees ESA as an authoritative body within the organization, one that defines and imposes security rules rather than negotiating standards and practices. This driver reflects the need for a decisive and assertive stance in setting security protocols, ensuring that there is a single source of truth for security practices that is not subject to internal debate."/>
