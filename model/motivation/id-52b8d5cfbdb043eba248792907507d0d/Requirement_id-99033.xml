    documentation="As the TEMA Business Owner I need to ensure that the scanning service itself is designed for assume the breach at all levels, with a very clear logical and administrative separation between the data, management and monitoring layers. This means that true observability needs to be designed in, and this telemetry must be protected against a compromise of TEMA itself. "/>
