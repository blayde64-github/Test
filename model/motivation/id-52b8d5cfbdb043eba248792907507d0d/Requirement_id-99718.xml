If tool is &quot;built in house&quot;, the 3rd party components included in the service are exposed to the internet. This needs to be combined with information about new vulnerabilities and exploits so that I can find most critical assets to mitigate and take corrective actions since internet facing assets are most exposed to threats. &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;CIS Control 7: &quot;In selecting which vulnerabilities to fix, or patches to apply, an enterprise should augment NISTs Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) with data concerning the likelihood of a threat actor using a vulnerability, or potential impact of an exploit to the enterprise. &quot;"/>
