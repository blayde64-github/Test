These should be linked together to find vulnerable targets with known exploits available. This is to ensure that we are aware of new vulnerabilities and vulnerable targets within our system at an early stage so we can take actions, start analyses and implement corrective actions before a security issue occurs. &#xA;&#xA;CIS Control 7: &quot;The release of a new exploit, or new intelligence relating to exploitation of the vulnerability, should change the priority through which the vulnerability should be considered for patching. &#xA;CIS Control 7: &quot;Various commercial systems are available to allow an enterprise to automate and maintain this process in a scalable manner.&quot;&#xA;"/>
