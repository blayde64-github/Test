Information on the likelihood of exploitation should also be periodically updated based on the most current threat information. For example, the release of a new exploit, or new intelligence relating to exploitation of the vulnerability, should change the priority through which the vulnerability should be considered for patching. Various commercial systems are available to allow an enterprise to automate and maintain this process in a scalable manner."/>
