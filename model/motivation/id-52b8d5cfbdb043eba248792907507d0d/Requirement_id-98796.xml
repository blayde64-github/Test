This can help highlight unmitigated critical vulnerabilities to senior management to ensure they are resolved. Enterprises can also track how long it took to remediate a vulnerability, after identified, or a patch has been issued. These can support internal or industry compliance requirements. Some mature enterprises will go over these reports in IT security steering committee meetings, which bring leaders from IT and the business together to prioritize remediation efforts based on business impact.&quot;"/>
