    documentation="This metric, &quot;Number of architectures with Security Baseline control requirement realizations,&quot; in essence, quantifies the systems or strategies we've crafted that incorporate established minimum security guidelines. Just as builders utilize a set of established safety standards when constructing buildings, we apply these 'Security Baselines' in the digital world to safeguard our information systems. Therefore, this measurement essentially tracks how many of our system designs have successfully integrated these fundamental security strategies.">
