    documentation="The &quot;Number of Security Controls Implemented&quot; metric measures the count of security controls that have been successfully implemented within our system or infrastructure. This metric focuses on the actual execution and deployment of the defined security controls. It provides a quantitative assessment of the progress made in implementing the necessary measures to protect our organization's assets, systems, and data. By tracking this metric, we can evaluate the effectiveness of our security program and gauge the level of coverage achieved in terms of control implementation. It serves as a vital indicator of our commitment to mitigating risks and ensuring a secure environment, demonstrating the tangible actions taken to enforce security measures and protocols across our systems and processes.">
