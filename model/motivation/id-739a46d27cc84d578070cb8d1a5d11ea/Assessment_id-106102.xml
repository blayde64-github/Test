    documentation="The metric &quot;Number of architectures with security requirements realizations&quot; refers to how many of our system designs have successfully implemented defined security needs or objectives. These 'security requirements' can be considered as a list of essential protective features or capabilities that a system must possess to ensure it can withstand cyber threats effectively. They can cover a broad range of aspects, from data protection to system resilience. This metric, therefore, helps us to measure how many of our system designs have successfully incorporated these security requirements, a crucial step towards building a secure and reliable digital infrastructure.">
