    documentation="The &quot;Number of new architectures known to bypass security review&quot; metric indicates the count of newly created system designs that, for some reason, have not undergone the usual security review process. A security review is a crucial step in verifying that a system's design aligns with the organization's security standards and best practices. Bypassing this review could potentially leave undiscovered vulnerabilities in the system. This metric, therefore, serves as a crucial red flag, drawing attention to any new designs that may need to be reviewed to ensure the overall security of our digital systems and infrastructure.">
