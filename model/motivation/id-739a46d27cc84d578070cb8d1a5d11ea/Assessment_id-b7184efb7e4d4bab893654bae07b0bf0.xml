    documentation="The &quot;Number of architectures that show how they align to our core processes&quot; metric is a count of the system designs that have been structured to effectively integrate and support our primary operations or business functions. These 'core processes' might include tasks that are fundamental to the service or product we provide. This metric is crucial as it reflects how many of our system designs are not only technically sound but also well-tuned to the unique needs and workings of our operations. It's a key indicator of the overall efficiency and synergy between our technology systems and business processes.">
