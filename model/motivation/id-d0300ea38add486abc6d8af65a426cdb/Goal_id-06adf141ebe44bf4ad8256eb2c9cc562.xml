To get overall understanding what assets + services needs security improvements in case the migration timeline is not sufficient.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;To meet this goal, we must understand what services we have in Norway and what is their migration timeline against DPS Transformation project. It might be, that there is easy wins where service is already obsole or can be migrated away in short timeframe.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However, we might see that majority of the services are required for few years before migration / rampdown can be made.
