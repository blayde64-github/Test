    documentation="This is according to Michael Lenahan in the Tech Services All-Hands Call 2023-06-01.&#xD;&#xA;Although this is an unusually technical goal for the leadership, Lenahan seem to understand it, which make it a still viable goal for the leadership.&#xD;&#xA;The assumption is that Lenahan is supporting the rest of the leadership in understanding this goal.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A key aspect of DigiOps, is that the actual customers are further down in the customer's organizations. It's a shift from large, costly and time intensive RFP processes, initiated by a customer's IT department, to quick consumption of services based on a decision further down."/>
