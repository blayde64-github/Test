    documentation="This is according to Michael Lenahan in the Tech Services All-Hands Call 2023-06-01.&#xD;&#xA;Although this is an unusually technical goal for the leadership, Lenahan seem to understand it, which make it a still viable goal for the leadership.&#xD;&#xA;The assumption is that Lenahan is supporting the rest of the leadership in understanding this goal.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;At its core, DevOps is about culture, people, and enabling tools and processes. It encourages more agile and responsive development, leveraging automation, continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD), microservices, infrastructure as code, monitoring, and testing, among others, to deliver software faster and more reliably.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;"/>
