    documentation="Statement: Protect customer identity&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Rationale: As part of increasing security awareness, we will need to communicate about past and current security issues we have had with customers. To ensure confidentiality of information, we should not name customers or present the cases in a way that the customer can be identified.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Implication: Never reveal customer names and make an effort to communicate in a way that doesn't make the customer case easy to idenfity. Make sure all information is clearly classified and thorough consideration is given when defining the classification."/>
