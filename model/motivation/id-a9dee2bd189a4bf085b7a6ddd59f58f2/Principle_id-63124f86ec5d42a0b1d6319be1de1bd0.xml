    documentation="Statement: Do not hide risk.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Rationale: Risk or risk realized is an internal part of security and behind the why we do many things, so why should not shy from mentioning it. However we need a balance, so the content doesn't become overly negative.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Implication: Risk should not be hidden and should be mentioned where relevant, but balanced with a more positive message. We should also express how the control helps mitigate risks, as well as positive opportunities that our progress will give us, as well as examples of things done right."/>
