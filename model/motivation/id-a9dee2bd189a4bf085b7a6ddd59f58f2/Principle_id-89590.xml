    documentation="Solutions and services need to be optimized from total cost of ownership (TCO) perspective. TCO needs to consider full solution lifecycle, including transformation, projects and run-phase, and all costs (labour, HW, SW, 3rd party services, SaaS; Tietoevry internal costs and 3rd party purchases). ​&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;TCO needs to be looked upon both from Tietoevry Tech Services delivery perspective and from the perspective of the customer who is consuming a Tietoevry service. The environmental cost; sustainability in production, delivery and consumption should be accounted for when concluding the TCO such as; material efficiency (waste and recycling) and energy efficiency and source.​&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Solutions and services must maximize leverage of good practices, standard methods, shared platforms, common capabilities, supplier frame-agreements, re-use of solutions and components to achieve “horizontal” optimization across Tietoevry Tech Services ​&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Solutions and services shall be designed to maximize use of automation and self-service in delivery of the service. ​"/>
