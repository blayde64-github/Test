    documentation="Statement: Thoughtful approach to releasing financial data&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Rationale: We need to be honest and at the same time we need to work with estimates and guesses at times. We need to consider how the way we express the numbers affects the message.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Implication: Consider the message we want to give when deciding on a way to express a financial number (e.g. 5M€ or several M€ or more than 1M€). Never release financial data outside of an internal audience. "/>
