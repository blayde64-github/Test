    documentation="During customer audit, their 3rd party penetration test team managed to breach to a server running in Norway management environment. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As a result, several security gaps were identified. The ones, which were directly related to this particular customer case were closed but there are still lot's of gaps which were left open.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Progress for fixing the issues has been slow. One major reason has been the unclarity on roles and responsibilities. Security team has identified technical vulnerabilities on around 1000 assets but the &quot;service relation&quot; for these assets is not clear. And since the owner is not there, the problems cannot be fixed.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Audun has been trying to lift the responbility to Sven-Erik Espeland but hasn't had good luck on that. Most propably it is due issue is not understood on that level.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;"/>
