    documentation="The Sovereign Cloud Service Squad team responsible for HiaaS and OCP have no specific interest in complying to the baseline - rather they want to make sure their service is secure and any gaps are found out now, not in customer security incidents. This supports the gap analysis approach for baseline implementation."/>
