    documentation="See the risks in the view &quot;Architecture Practice Risks Influencing Security by Design&quot;. Thanks to an extremely underdeveloped architecture practice architects do not work as a consistent architecture practice or properly manage architecture complexity. This means that any attempt to introduce and perceived complexity will likely be met with negativity in some areas. Because the architect role is normally under resourced and architect roles are normally filled with non-architecture work, architects generally do not have time to do architecture, and deprioritize design. Rather than using methodology, architecture is seen as a documentation exercise which architects just want to avoid."/>
