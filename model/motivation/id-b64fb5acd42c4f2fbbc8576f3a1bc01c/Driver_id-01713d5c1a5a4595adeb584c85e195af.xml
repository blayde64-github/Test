    documentation="Restricting Management Activities. This section would regulate the authority of the supervisory authority to limit the activities of individuals in the leadership of a key entity if they repeatedly and seriously violate their obligations as set out in the proposed ยง10. This would involve a temporary ban for an individual from acting in the top management positions of the said company, which would include, for example, board members and alternate members, supervisory board members and alternate members, the CEO, or other equivalent positions, as well as positions directly under the CEO in which individuals have actual decision-making authority on issues regarding compliance with this law. Depending on the structure of the organization, such positions could include, for example, the Chief Financial Officer, Chief Operating Officer, Chief Administrative Officer, or other similar senior management. However, this section would not apply to private entrepreneurs or partnerships, i.e., general partnerships or limited partnerships.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Restricting management activities is a severe consequence, and imposing a ban should be exceptional. The supervisory authority should give the entity a notice or warning and a reasonable period to correct the non-compliant activity before restricting management activities. The prerequisite for the activity ban would be the repetition and severity of the violations, which would require that the entity has already been ordered an administrative penalty for the violation or negligence, or the supervisory authority has otherwise intervened in the entity's illegal or deficient activities. Thus, it would be a measure of last resort to prevent the recurrence of illegal conduct. In each individual case, the supervisory authority must assess whether the activity ban is the most appropriate supervisory measure.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However, restricting management activities under the proposed section would not be possible if the key entity is a public administration actor.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This section would implement subsection b of paragraph 5 of Article 32 of the NIS2 Directive. The authority could only be applied to a key entity, as the NIS2 Directive does not require similar supervisory authority to be applied to entities other than key entities."/>
