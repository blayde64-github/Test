    documentation="The observed lack of focus on security architecture within our organization is a key vulnerability in our overall system design and implementation processes. Our architects' persistent avoidance of this critical aspect is creating a gap in the comprehensive architecture framework that is required for efficient and secure operations. The inability to adequately integrate security architecture into our design processes is potentially leaving unchecked loopholes in our systems. In light of the business event that necessitates architecture reviews, it's evident that without a focus on security architecture, our reviews may fail to identify important security concerns. This situation underscores the need to address the incorporation of security architecture as a fundamental part of our systems design and operational procedures.">
