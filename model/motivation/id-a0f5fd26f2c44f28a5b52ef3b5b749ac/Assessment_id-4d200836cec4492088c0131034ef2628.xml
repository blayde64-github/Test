This can lead to inconsistent access management, increased risk of unauthorized access, and difficulty in tracking and auditing user activities. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Such systems may not comply with established security policies, making them more susceptible to breaches and cyber threats, and complicating compliance with regulatory requirements.">
