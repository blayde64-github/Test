    documentation="The vulnerability associated with systems that don't support more than 12-character password lengths lies in their limited password complexity. Shorter passwords are generally easier to crack using brute-force or dictionary attacks. This limitation restricts users from creating more complex, and therefore more secure, passwords. As a result, these systems are more susceptible to being compromised, increasing the risk of unauthorized access and potential data breaches. Longer passwords are a fundamental aspect of robust cybersecurity practices.">
